CROP RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM..!

[Crop_Recommendation_README.1.docx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20540197/Crop_Recommendation_README.1.docx)


ðŸŒ¾ Crop Recommendation System

A smart machine learningâ€“based web application that recommends the most suitable crop to grow based on soil and weather conditions.
Built as a final-year major project, this system uses real-world agricultural data to assist farmers, students, and researchers 
in precision farming.


 Project Objective
 

To build an end-to-end crop recommendation system using machine learning that:

- Predicts the best crop to grow using environmental factors
- Provides an easy-to-use web interface built with Streamlit
- Can be deployed and shared via GitHub and Streamlit Cloud

Dataset

-  Name: Crop_recommendation.csv
-  Records: 2200 rows Ã— 8 columns
-  Features:
  - N, P, K â€” Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium levels in soil
  - temperature, humidity, ph, rainfall â€” Environmental factors
  - label â€” Target crop to be predicted (e.g., rice, maize, apple,Coffee)


 
Tech Stack

 Layer                  Tool / Language     

 ML Model          Random Forest Classifier (sklearn) 
 Frontend           Streamlit           
 Data Prep          Pandas, Seaborn, Numpy     
 Environment   Google Colab + Python 
 Deployment     Streamlit Cloud / Localhost 
 Versioning       Git & GitHub   


 ML Workflow

1. Data preprocessing:

   - pH categorized as Acidic / Neutral / Basic
   - Rainfall bucketed as Low / Medium / High (for analysis)
   - No missing values or duplicates

3. Model building:
   
   - Label encoding used on crop names
   - Trained using RandomForestClassifier with 99.3% accuracy
   - Saved using joblib (rf_crop_model.pkl & label_encoder.pkl)




5. Evaluation:
   
- Classification report
